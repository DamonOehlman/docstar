Getting Started
===============

Getting started with DocStar is simple.  Firstly install it using NPM::

	npm install -g docstar

Once installed you should then be able to run it from the command-line.  For example, running ``docstar --help`` should yield something like::

	Usage: docstar [options]

	Options:

	  -h, --help         output usage information
	  -V, --version      output the version number
	  -p, --path [path]  Target output path (default to current directory)
