# docstar

Docstar is a collection of tools to assist with build great looking docs for
JS libraries.  These tools are designed to help bridge the gap between
[Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org) and current JavaScript documentation tools.

The goal is to make documenting a library a well understood and repeatable
process, which in turn makes it feel easier.  The result being that having
documentation that is easier to write and maintain, improves the quality of
documentation have a net positive effect for the whole community.

## Other Tools

I have moved across to using [gendocs](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/gendocs)
which feels like it has less overheads.  Additionally people visit documentation
sites less than they read README files.
